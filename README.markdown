# Resume2 ##

## Description ##

Resume2 is a command line tool to manage your resume from a central data (YAML) file.  Why YAML? Because no one should ever have to write an XML file.

Right now it will process a Markdown file and merge the data into it. From there you can create a PDF or HTML via TextMate.  Plenty of refinements before I even contemplate labeling it ready for public consumption.

## Installation ##

sudo gem install n3bulous-resume2 --source=http://gems.github.com

## Usage ##

Initial instructions:

1. Create a resume.yml file, nesting your data as appropriate to capture the data, basically a collection of hashes and arrays:

		name:
			given: Kevin
			surname: McFadden

		skills:
		  brief:
		    - [ "Databases", "MySQL, Oracle 8i/9i, Informix 7, PostgreSQL" ]
		    - [ "Programming", "Ruby, PHP, Java, BASH, Forth, Perl, C, C++, Objective C" ]
		    - [ "Operating Systems", "Linux, Solaris, OS X, HP-UX, MS Windows" ]
		    - [ "Miscellaneous", "Scrum, XP, Subversion, Git, CVS, XHTML, XML, XML-RPC, AJAX" ]
	
2. Create a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) template to style the resume.

		<div style="font-style: bold; font-size: 1.4em; text-align: center"><%= "#{name.given} #{name.surname}" %></div>
		<div style="text-align: center">
		<p>
		<%= "#{address.street}, #{address.city}, #{address.state}, #{address.postal.to_s}" %><br/>
		<%= "#{contact.email} | #{contact.mobile}" %><br/>
		<%= contact.urls.linkedin %><br/>
		</p>
		</div>

		<table>
		<% skills.brief.each do |a| %>
			<tr>
				<th><%= a[0] %></th>
				<td><%= a[1] %></td>
			</tr>
		<% end %>
		</table>

3. Combine the two with resume2 to generate the Markdown output.

		resume2 markdown resume.markdown.erb resume.yml > resume.markdown

4. Right now I'm using [MultiMarkDown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/multimarkdown_bundle_for_textm/) with TextMate to generate the HTML/PDF, but I'm aiming to streamline the process and avoid using TextMate in my process.  MultiMarkDown supports CSS allowing for better styling.

MultiMarkDown is a Perl script, so the final version may require its installation...

## TODO ##

* .resume2rc config file to specify defaults for resume file paths, resume.yml, and theme.
* Refine 
* Refactor generator to handle the different outputs.
* Support direct, PDF output.
* Support RTF templates.
* Support XHTML, Markdown, and text templates.  (essentially done, needs cleanup)
* Full examples.

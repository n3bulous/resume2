# Resume2 ##

## Description ##

Resume2 is a command line tool to manage your resume from a central data (YAML) file.

Right now it will process a Markdown file and merge the data into it. From there you can create a PDF or HTML via TextMate.  Plenty of refinements before I even contemplate labeling it ready for public consumption.

## Installation ##

(once the gemspec has been written and tested...)

sudo gem install n3bulous-resume2 --source=http://gems.github.com
